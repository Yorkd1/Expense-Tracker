# Overview

This project is an opportunity for me to further my skills in JavaScript programming. For this program I wanted to create an expense tracker that takes information from the user and stores it as an object that is used in a table and a graph after the information is stored.

The purpose for writing this program was to further my understanding on DOM element manipulation using JavaScript as well as utilizing a Library I had not used before to make the site more appealing and interactive.

The following is a video demonstration on YouTube that goes over the website and a code walk through.
